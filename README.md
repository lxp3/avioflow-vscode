# Avioflow Audio Previewer for VS Code

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxp3/avioflow-vscode/main/resources/preview.gif">

High-performance audio previewer for VS Code using the `avioflow` native engine. This extension provides a custom editor for various audio formats, allowing users to visualize waveforms and inspect metadata directly within VS Code.

## UI & Controls

- **Waveform View**: Visualizes multiple audio channels (CH 0, CH 1, etc.).
- **Metadata Panel**: Displays File Name, Size, Format, Codec, Duration, Sample Rate, and Bitrate.
- **Decoding Info**: Shows total load time and actual decoding time.

### Shortcuts
- **Space**: Play / Pause audio.
- **Mouse Wheel / Trackpad Scroll**: Zoom in/out of the waveform.
- **Click & Drag**: Navigate through the zoomed waveform.
- **Reset Button**: Restore original zoom level.

## Architecture

This extension uses a high-performance **WebAssembly (WASM)** core built from C++ and FFmpeg. This ensures fast decoding while maintaining cross-platform compatibility without native Node.js binary headaches.
